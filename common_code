/* go

channel
buffer channels like mailboxes in Erlang

don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating  (not a mem blob with locks or mutexes or cond var, protect para / 
but use channel to pass data back and forth)

function that returns a channel
* also as a handle on a service

fan-in function - multiplexer
* than can restore sequencing if needed (use Message struct) - wiat channel

select stmt - a control structure unique to concurrency
  looks like a switch, each case is a communication
  will block if no default case
